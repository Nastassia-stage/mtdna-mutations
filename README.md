# mtdna-mutations
During a four months internship at Imperial College of London, I worked with Professor Nick Jones and Doctor Ferdinando Insalata to simulate mtdna mutations in muscle fibers.

My job was to create a new model that could explain how the mutants behaved in the fiber and if their expansion was due to a slower death and birth porcesses or a higher death and birth processes compared to the wildtypes cells of the fiber.
