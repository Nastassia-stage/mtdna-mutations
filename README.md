## Research project at Imperial College, London

# Context 
During the summer of 2024 at Imperial College of London, I worked as a bio mathematician associate with Professor Nick Jones and Doctor Ferdinando Insalata to simulate mtdna mutations in muscle fibers. The group focuses on learning how the mutants and the wildtypes behaved in the cells, with stochastic and statistical processes. You can learn more about thei work with this paper. 

My job was to create a new model that could explain how the mutants behaved in the fiber and if their expansion was due to a slower death and birth porcesses or a higher death and birth processes compared to the wildtypes cells of the fiber. Later on, with this new model I was able to particpate in the writing of  a new article, wich will be soon published.
